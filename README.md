# Description
This is a webpage created as part of Epicodus friday project to practice JavaScript's loops. User enters and submits a number, the webpage will "talk" back to the user, returning a range of numbers starting from 0 to the number that was submitted by user. If the number submitted has a 1, 2 or a 3, those numbers will be swaped out for robot-esque responses.
